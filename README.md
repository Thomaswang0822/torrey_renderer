## Introduction

This is the course project of [UCSD CSE 168 Computer Graphics II: Rendering](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tzli/cse168/sp2023/). Throughout the quarter, we built a physically-based renderer (from ray-tracing to path-tracing) almost from scratch.

All the high-level feature descriptions and concept explanations are outlined in our homework specification:

- [Homework 1: Ray Tracing](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tzli/cse168/sp2023/homework1.pdf)
- [Homework 2: Triangles and acceleration structures](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tzli/cse168/sp2023/homework2.pdf)
- [Homework 3: Textures, shading normals, Fresnel, and area lights](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tzli/cse168/sp2023/homework3.pdf)
- [Homework 4: Indirect lighting, BRDFs, and Multiple Importance Sampling](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tzli/cse168/sp2023/homework4.pdf)

## Feature Highlights

My renderer implements many fundamental features and functionalities presented in modern renderer. Here are some selected ones, sorted from their order in homework specification:

### Antialiasing

### Parallelization

### Defocus Blur

### XML Scene Parser

### Acceleration Structure

### Motion Blur

### Texture Mapping

### Shading Normals

### Area Light (Monte Carlo Importance Sampling)

### Efficient Sampling Strategies

### Path-Tracing

### BRDF for Different Materials

### Multiple Importance Sampling

### Russian Roulette

## Attribute

All the low-level implementation details and design decisions are made by myself, but the high-level ideas are heavily influenced and supported by the following people and sources:

- [Professor Tzu-mao Li, course instructor](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tzli/)
- [Trevor Hedstrom, course TA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevor-hedstrom-9abb6362)

- [Eric Veach's thesis](https://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/veach_thesis/), the famous "Bible" for rendering theory foundation.
- Many utilities used by the starter code attributed on [starter code README](https://github.com/BachiLi/torrey_public#acknowledgement)
- And many other papers/theses for particular techniques. They are attached to the homework specification files and also in @ref section of my code implementation.
